This repository contains the matlab code for my final project for Math 568 (mathematical and computational neuroscience). 
I haven't figured out how to include subdirectories in a way that doesn't require writing a bunch of overhead, so the base file of the directory will be a mess for the foreseeable future.
Some of the dynamical systems and SOS programming tools won't be cited for now, but once I have a writeup with adequate citations, I'll link that here. No plagarism is intended.
